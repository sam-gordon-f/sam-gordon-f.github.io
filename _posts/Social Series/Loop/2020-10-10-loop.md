##### (jbhifi) Creating SPA's
  - They needed to migrate off 8 large instances because of the price and manual scaling
  - My job was a cloud architect at the time
  - We started with just the checkout, and I built the infrastructure for all the API's and the S3 hosting / CDN
    - server loads went down
    - order conversion rate went up (10%)
    - registrations went up

##### (post) Homogenising the AWS accounts
  - They had approx 30 accounts with no governance / security
  - My job was a senior cloud architect at the time
  - I designed and built a governance baseline that could be run across all environments
    - More teams requested their own environments (up to 150)
    - Turn around time went from weeks to hours

##### (post) SOE Networks
  - They had no conformity around how to do networking at post
  - My job was a senior cloud architect at the time
  - I designed and built a networking template for most "known" requirements at the time
    - the network was used across 50+ environments
    - Turn around time went from weeks to hours
    - We actually had a security posture
    - changes were easy to role out
    - it all became simple

##### (karate personal) (make sure to ask)
  - I run a martial arts school
  - My role is the head instructor
  - I have to inspire people and lead through influence rather than authority
    - I've run approx 50 black belts through my school (which is a min of 5 years)

##### (securepay) SCP, and compliance
  - secure wished to move into AWS
  - My job was a senior cloud architect at the time
  - I suggested / scoped a number of initiaves to help with complaince in the cloud
    - One of the successful activities was writing SCP for their accounts to restrict only compliant services
    - This gave the confidence and trust that they were working within secure bounds

  - My job was a senior cloud architect at the time
  - I designed and POC'ed a TGW solution
    - When the migration efforts were called into question, the business pivoted and decided it was too risky

##### (post) Elastic Search cluster Failure
  - A team performed a cloudformation update to an ES cluster, which failed to stabilize
  - I saw the support case raised with AWS
  - The team didnt have the technical skills to diagnose or communicate the issue, so I helped create a timeline to
    co-ordinate with the Support team, and Business Stakeholders
    - The result was that we brought the cluster back up, and re-processed the entries that were missing. Bringing the project back online
      (total of 4 hours)
