The Major concepts are fairly straight forward, and they follow the actions below

1) Cloudformation templates are written to describe infrastructure in the desired state. These can be written in JSON / YML, or any number of DSL's ( `official and otherwise` )
  
2) These templates are then fed to cloudformation with the `createStack` directive
  
3) The service will attempt to create a stack containing the resource(s) aforementioned
  
4) Moving forwards, the following `operations` can be undertaken
  
---

  a. `deleteStack`, which will attempt to remove all resources
    
  b. `updateStack`, which will take an updated template and attempt to update all resources to match the new changes
  
  c. `createChangeSet`, which will attempt to create a list of changes that would occur if an update was executed
  
  d. `executeChangeSet`, which will attempt to update the stack, much like the `updateStack` operation

---

5) If an issue occurs with any of the above steps. The service will attempt to revert to the `previous known state`. This is why the service is so powerful !
