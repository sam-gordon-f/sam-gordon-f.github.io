Most Cloudformation stacks follow the below pattern

##### Typical Lifecycle
1. [Write Templates](#write-template)
2. [Create Stacks](#create)
3. [Next Steps](#next)
4. [Error](#next-operation)

[Diagram of cardinality](#diagram)

<a name = "write-template"></a>
##### 1) Write Cloudformation templates

These reflect the desired state of your infrastructure, and can be written in JSON / YML, or any number of DSLs (domain specific language)
  
<br>

<a name = "create"></a>
##### 2) Execute `createStack` action alongside your template

This gives Cloudformation the command to create a stack to house the resources reflected in your template
  
<div class="card tip">
  <div class="card-body">
    You could also use the `createChangeSet` directive to give an indication on what the template will create before running
  </div>
</div>
<br>
  
<a name = "next"></a>
##### 3) Next Steps

After the stack(s) stabilizes, all of your infrastructure will have been created. Moving forwards, the following `operations` can be undertaken

  > a. `deleteStack`, which will attempt to remove all resources<br>
  > b. `updateStack`, which will take an updated template and attempt to update all resources to match the new changes<br>
  > c. `createChangeSet`, which will attempt to create a list of changes that would occur if an update was executed<br>
  > d. `executeChangeSet`, which will attempt to update the stack, much like the `updateStack` operation

<br>

<a name = "error"></a>
##### 4) Errors

If there are any errors with the above, the service will attempt to revert to the `previous known state`. This is one of the key reasons why the service is so powerful !

##### Diagram

The below diagram shows the below cardinality

- Each template can creates one stack (with potentially nested children stacks)
- Each stack contains one or more resources
- Each stack can have zero or many changesets
